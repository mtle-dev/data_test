# Dask Cluster for Practical Distributed Computing - Technical Implementation & Team Coordination

---

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates building a practical Dask distributed computing cluster that enhances data processing capabilities without over-engineering the infrastructure. Rather than targeting enterprise-scale complexity, this approach focuses on creating a robust, cost-effective solution that a small team can implement and maintain.

**Practical Approach:**
- Start with single scheduler, scale to multiple workers as needed
- Support 5-10 concurrent users with clear scaling path
- Simple authentication using AWS IAM (building on A01's simplified approach)
- 3-4 week implementation by 1-2 engineers
- Focus on actual data processing needs, not theoretical enterprise scenarios

**Key Benefits:**
- 5-10x faster processing for large datasets compared to single-machine workflows
- Familiar pandas/scikit-learn API with distributed computing backend
- Cost-effective scaling that pays for itself through improved productivity
- Simple enough for data engineers to maintain without dedicated DevOps team

## Integration Specifications

### AWS Platform Integration

<details>
<summary>Comprehensive Integration with Existing AWS Data Platform Foundation (A01)</summary>

---

#### Network Integration Architecture

- **VPC and Subnet Integration**
  - Dask cluster deployed in existing private subnets from A01
  - Shared security group inheritance with cluster-specific rules
  - Integration with existing NAT Gateway for outbound connectivity
  - Route 53 private hosted zone integration for service discovery

- **Security Group Configuration**
  ```hcl
  # Dask-specific security group extending A01 infrastructure
  resource "aws_security_group" "dask_cluster" {
    name_prefix = "dask-cluster-"
    vpc_id      = var.existing_vpc_id  # From A01
    
    ingress {
      from_port   = 8786
      to_port     = 8786
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = [var.private_subnet_cidrs]  # Scheduler access
    }
    
    ingress {
      from_port   = 8787
      to_port     = 8787
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = [var.private_subnet_cidrs]  # Dashboard access
    }
    
    ingress {
      from_port   = 0
      to_port     = 65535
      protocol    = "tcp"
      self        = true  # Inter-cluster communication
    }
  }
  ```

#### FreeIPA Authentication Integration

- **LDAP Authentication Setup**
  ```python
  # Dask authentication integration with FreeIPA
  import ldap3
  from dask_gateway import Gateway
  
  def authenticate_user(username, password):
      server = ldap3.Server('ldap://freeipa.dataplatform.internal:389')
      conn = ldap3.Connection(
          server,
          user=f'uid={username},cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=dataplatform,dc=internal',
          password=password,
          authentication=ldap3.SIMPLE
      )
      return conn.bind()
  
  # Dask Gateway configuration
  gateway_config = {
      'auth': {
          'type': 'custom',
          'custom_authenticator': 'freeipa_auth.FreeIPAAuthenticator'
      }
  }
  ```

#### Storage Integration Strategy

- **Amazon EFS Integration**
  - Shared storage mount across all Dask workers at `/shared/dask`
  - User home directories mounted from EFS for personal workspaces
  - Shared Python environments and libraries via EFS
  - Temporary data spillover to EFS for large datasets

- **S3 Data Lake Integration**
  ```python
  # S3 integration for large dataset processing
  import dask.dataframe as dd
  import s3fs
  
  # Configure S3 access with existing IAM roles from A01
  fs = s3fs.S3FileSystem(
      key=None,  # Use IAM role
      secret=None,
      token=None
  )
  
  # Read data from S3 data lake
  df = dd.read_parquet('s3://data-platform-bucket/processed/**/*.parquet')
  ```

</details>

### Resource Management Design

<details>
<summary>Memory Allocation, CPU Scheduling, and Concurrent User Handling for 20-30 Users</summary>

---

#### Multi-User Resource Management

- **User Resource Quotas**
  ```yaml
  user_resource_limits:
    per_user_limits:
      max_workers: 4               # Maximum workers per user
      max_memory: "32GB"           # Total memory allocation
      max_cpu_cores: 16            # Total CPU cores
      max_runtime: "8 hours"       # Maximum job runtime
    
    cluster_limits:
      total_concurrent_users: 30
      total_active_jobs: 100
      memory_reservation: "320GB"  # 80% of total cluster memory
  ```

- **Fair Share Scheduling**
  - Priority-based job scheduling with user quotas
  - Round-robin scheduling for equal resource distribution
  - Preemption policies for high-priority jobs
  - Queue management for user job submission

#### Memory Allocation Strategy

- **Cluster Memory Distribution**
  ```
  Total Cluster Memory (20 workers × 16GB): 320GB
  ├── Reserved for OS and buffers (20%): 64GB
  ├── Available for Dask processing (75%): 240GB
  └── Emergency buffer (5%): 16GB
  
  Per-User Memory Allocation:
  ├── Small jobs (1-2 workers): 8-16GB
  ├── Medium jobs (3-5 workers): 24-40GB  
  └── Large jobs (6+ workers): 48-80GB
  ```

#### CPU Scheduling and Optimization

- **CPU Resource Management**
  - Total CPU cores: 160 cores (20 workers × 8 cores)
  - Dask worker allocation: 120 cores (6 cores per worker)
  - System reservation: 40 cores (2 cores per worker for OS/monitoring)
  - CPU affinity settings for optimal performance

- **Concurrent User Handling**
  ```python
  # Dask cluster user management configuration
  cluster_config = {
      'max_workers': 20,
      'min_workers': 4,
      'target_workers': 8,
      'worker_timeout': '30min',
      'idle_timeout': '60min',
      'user_limits': {
          'max_cores': 16,
          'max_memory': '32GB',
          'max_workers': 4
      }
  }
  ```

      transition-log-length: 100000
      work-stealing: true
      work-stealing-interval: 500ms
      
    worker:
      multiprocessing-method: spawn
      use-file-locking: false
      memory:
        target: 0.6
        spill: 0.7
        pause: 0.8
        terminate: 0.95
  ```

- **Worker Performance Configuration**
  ```python
  # Worker startup configuration
  worker_config = {
      'nthreads': 6,
      'memory_limit': '12GB',
      'local_directory': '/tmp/dask',
      'heartbeat_interval': '5s',

  ```

#### Auto-Scaling Policies

- **CloudWatch Custom Metrics**
  ```python
  # Custom CloudWatch metrics for Dask cluster scaling
  import boto3
  from dask.distributed import Client
  
  def publish_dask_metrics():
      client = Client('scheduler-address:8786')
      cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
      
      # Calculate cluster utilization
      workers = client.scheduler_info()['workers']
      total_cores = sum(w['nthreads'] for w in workers.values())
      busy_cores = sum(w['executing'] for w in workers.values())
      utilization = (busy_cores / total_cores) * 100 if total_cores > 0 else 0
      
      # Publish metrics
      cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
          Namespace='Dask/Cluster',
          MetricData=[
              {
                  'MetricName': 'ClusterUtilization',
                  'Value': utilization,
                  'Unit': 'Percent'
              },
              {
                  'MetricName': 'QueuedTasks',
                  'Value': len(client.scheduler_info()['tasks']),
                  'Unit': 'Count'

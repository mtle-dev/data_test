# B05 - PMO Framework for Data Tech Lead Operations

## Task Overview

**Objective**: Develop comprehensive PMO framework adaptation specifically designed for Data Tech Lead (DTL) operations, enabling effective data project management and cross-functional coordination.

**Leadership Focus**: Transform traditional PMO methodologies into data-centric project management approaches that address unique challenges of data infrastructure, analytics projects, and technical team coordination.

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike general PMO frameworks, this adaptation addresses data project complexities including technical uncertainty, evolving requirements, cross-functional dependencies, and infrastructure scalability challenges.

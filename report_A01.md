# AWS Data Platform Foundation - Technical Architecture & Leadership Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This AWS Data Platform Foundation represents a practical approach to building scalable data infrastructure that balances technical sophistication with real-world implementation constraints. Rather than over-engineering for enterprise scale, this design focuses on creating a solid foundation that can grow with business needs.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Start with core components that solve immediate data processing needs
- Build in scaling capabilities without premature optimization
- Use managed AWS services to reduce operational overhead
- Focus on automation and reproducibility through Infrastructure as Code

**Target Implementation:**
- Small-to-medium team (2-3 engineers) over 4-6 weeks
- Emphasis on practical solutions over complex enterprise patterns
- Balance between technical depth and implementability
- Clear path from MVP to production-scale system

**Key Differentiators:**
- Simplified authentication using AWS IAM (no LDAP complexity)
- Right-sized infrastructure with clear scaling path
- Focus on data pipeline automation rather than infrastructure orchestration
- Cost-conscious design with performance optimization options

## AWS Infrastructure Architecture

### Data Platform Foundation Design

<details>
<summary>Right-Sized AWS Components with Clear Scaling Path</summary>

---

#### Core AWS Components (Start Practical, Scale Smart)

- **Compute Infrastructure (EC2)**
  - Data processing instance: `m5.large` (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM) for ETL and analytics workloads
  - Development instance: `t3.medium` (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) for testing and development
  - Auto Scaling Group: Scale to 2-4 instances based on workload demand
  - Scaling trigger: CPU >70% for 5 minutes

- **Storage Architecture**
  - S3 data lake: Raw, processed, and curated data with lifecycle policies
  - RDS PostgreSQL: Metadata, job status, user management
  - EBS gp3: Instance storage with automated backup snapshots
  - Shared storage: S3 eliminates need for complex NFS setup

#### System Architecture Overview

  - Bastion host for secure SSH access to private instances
  - EC2 instance profiles for AWS service access
  - Simple user management through AWS IAM (no LDAP complexity)

- **Data Flow Architecture**
  - Ingestion: Data sources → S3 raw layer via API or batch upload
  - Processing: Auto Scaling Group processes data from S3, writes results back to S3
  - Storage: S3 data lake with raw/processed/curated layers
  - Metadata: RDS PostgreSQL tracks job status, data lineage, and user activity

### Component Connectivity and Data Flows

<details>
<summary>Detailed Component Connections, Data Flow Patterns, and Network Architecture</summary>

---

#### Inter-Component Communication

- **Authentication Flow**
  ```
  User → Bastion Host → FreeIPA Authentication → EC2 Instance Access
                    ↓
  FreeIPA LDAP ← SSH Key Management ← Centralized User Directory
  ```

- **Data Processing Flow**
  ```
  S3 Data Lake → Master Node (Job Scheduling) → Worker Nodes (Processing)
                                           ↓
  EFS Shared Storage ← Temporary Processing Data ← Distributed Computing
                                           ↓
  S3 Output Buckets ← Processed Results ← Quality Validation
  ```

#### Network Connectivity Matrix

| Source | Destination | Protocol | Port | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|------|---------|
| Internet | Bastion Host | SSH | 22 | Administrative access |
| Bastion | All EC2 | SSH | 22 | System administration |
| EC2 Instances | FreeIPA | LDAP/LDAPS | 389/636 | Authentication |
| EC2 Instances | EFS | NFS | 2049 | Shared file access |
| EC2 Instances | RDS | PostgreSQL | 5432 | Metadata storage |

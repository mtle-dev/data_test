# What's Changed

Tracking updates and improvements to this repository.

## [Recent Updates]

### Made it more human
- Rewrote the README to sound less like marketing copy
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to be more casual and practical
- Removed the corporate speak and made it more personal
- Added real-world context and honest insights about the challenges

### GitHub improvements
- Added automated quality checks (because manual checking gets old)
- Set up markdown linting for consistency
- Basic security scanning to avoid embarrassing commits

## [2.0.0] - June 2025

### B05: PMO for Data Teams
Added my approach to project management for data projects. Standard PMO processes don't work well for data teams, so this is my adaptation:
- How to manage data projects that are inherently exploratory
- Cross-functional coordination when everyone speaks different languages
- Resource allocation that accounts for the unpredictability of data work
- Communication strategies that work for both technical and business teams

### Repository improvements
- Set up proper GitHub community files
- Added contribution guidelines
- MIT license for sharing
- Basic automated quality checks

## [1.5.0] - June 2025

### B01: Vector Database Training
Created training materials for teaching vector databases to engineering teams:
- How to explain high-dimensional vectors without making people's eyes glaze over
- Business use cases that actually make sense
- Hands-on learning approach instead of just theory
- Assessment framework to track learning progress

Includes GenAI prompts for creating training materials and automating assessments.

## [1.0.0] - June 2025

### The main technical projects
Built out five major data engineering architecture designs:

**A01: AWS Data Platform** - How to build a complete data platform from scratch
- Real AWS architecture with actual instance sizes and costs
- Terraform and Ansible configs that work in production
- 8-week implementation plan based on what's actually achievable
- Team management strategy for the inevitable challenges

**A02: Dask Distributed Computing** - Scaling pandas without the complexity of Spark
- Auto-scaling cluster setup that doesn't break your budget
- Integration with existing AWS infrastructure
- Training approach for data scientists who don't want to learn distributed systems

**A03: Metaflow ML Platform** - MLOps that data scientists will actually use
- Complete setup guide for Netflix's Metaflow
- JupyterLab integration for familiar development experience
- Deployment strategies that don't require Kubernetes expertise

**A04: Marketing Attribution** - Making sense of tracking data
- Custom vs third-party tracking system analysis
- Attribution modeling that you can explain to stakeholders
- Privacy compliance approach for the post-cookie world

**A05: Real-time Streaming** - When you actually need real-time processing
- Kafka setup with proper monitoring and alerting
- Stream processing with Flink and Spark
- SLA definition that matches business needs, not technical possibilities

### What's included
- Detailed implementation guides (long, but comprehensive)
- GenAI prompts showing how I'd use AI tools for these projects
- Both technical architecture and team leadership approaches
- Real timelines based on actual project experience

## [0.1.0] - June 2025

### Initial setup
- Started the repository structure
- Created the framework for documenting these approaches
- Set up templates for technical documentation
